# data-science-toolbox
What began as a place for me to store my notes has evolved into a repository for all things data science.

So far this includes:

* Notes: Python basics, data visualization, Pandas shenanigans and various machine learning experiments
* Tutorials: [Kaggle Micro-Course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning) work 

Down the rabbit hole I go.
