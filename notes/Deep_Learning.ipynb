    "* Jupyter Notebooks - to create models\n",
    "* Deep Learning Framework - high or low level options to implement/test neural networks (ex: Keras)\n",

    "Popular deep learning frameworks include Keras, CNTK and Theano (depricated). Keras, the de facto choice, uses TensorFlow as the execution engine and can export models to be ingested by other frameworks such as DeepLearning4J and Apache System ML via open standard exchange formats such as ONNX."
